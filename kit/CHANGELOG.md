# Changelog

All notable changes to `@nimiplatform/kit` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
The project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
with the pre-1.0 discipline documented in `kit/AGENTS.md` §Semver
Discipline.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- Hardened npm package publishing so public subpath exports resolve to
  compiled `dist` JavaScript and declaration files instead of raw
  `src/**/*.ts` / `src/**/*.tsx` source files.
- Added a dist package guard that fails when package exports point outside
  `dist`, leak source paths, or reference missing build outputs.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-23

Initial public publish for the ST-L1-2 standardization work.
`@nimiplatform/kit` becomes the single cross-app toolkit package
for Nimi apps with 58 public subpath exports while remaining in a
pre-1.0 iteration phase.

### Added

- **Public exports inventory** (58 entries): 11 UI entries (`./ui`,
  `./ui/glass`, `./ui/motion`, `./ui/a11y`, `./ui/styles.css`, and six
  `./ui/themes/*` files), 3 auth entries, 6 core entries (including
  `./core/sdk-contract`), 2 renderer-shell entries, 2 telemetry entries,
  and 34 feature entries across `chat`, `avatar`, `model-picker`,
  `model-config`, `generation`, `commerce`.
  Full inventory in
  `.nimi/topics/ongoing/2026-05-23-nimi-kit-component-library-standardization/kit-public-surface-inventory.yaml`.
- **SDK contract boundary admission** at `kit/core/src/sdk-contract.ts`:
  single audit surface for kit-to-SDK coupling. All static
  `@nimiplatform/sdk*` imports inside kit code (non-test) route through
  this file. Re-exports cover 5 admitted S-SURFACE-001 sub-paths
  (`/`, `/runtime`, `/realm`, `/types`, `/mod`).
- **a11y primitives module** (`./ui/a11y`): `FOCUS_RING_CLASS_NAME`
  applied to `Button` and `IconButton` for WCAG 2.1 AA keyboard focus
  visibility, `VisuallyHidden` helper, focus-trap hook.
- **Motion primitives module** (`./ui/motion`): SSR-safe
  `usePrefersReducedMotion` hook and `MOTION_TIMING` tokens. Respects
  `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
- **Glass primitives module** (`./ui/glass`): shared frosted-surface
  primitives extracted from prior duplicated implementations across
  feature modules.
- **Cross-feature edge documentation**: `chat → avatar` and
  `model-config → model-picker` admitted as documented one-way feature
  compositions. Documented at `kit/core/src/sdk-contract.ts` header and
  `kit/AGENTS.md` §Cross-Feature Edges.
- **Counting vocabulary** for SDK-coupling audits at `kit/AGENTS.md`
  §Counting Vocabulary: `importing-file count`, `import-statement count`,
  `export-statement count` kept distinct.
- **Semver discipline doc** at `kit/AGENTS.md` §Semver Discipline:
  pre-1.0 patch/minor/major classification rules, migration-note
  requirements for breaking 0.x minors, and directional alignment with
  `@nimiplatform/sdk`.

### Changed

- **`kit/features/chat/src/runtime/orchestration.ts`**: the dynamic
  SDK import for `getPlatformClient` now routes through
  `@nimiplatform/kit/core/sdk-contract` instead of
  `@nimiplatform/sdk` directly, eliminating the last bypass of the
  single-boundary contract.
- **`kit/README.md`**: rewritten as external-consumer documentation
  covering installation, version policy, import patterns by sub-module,
  theming integration, accessibility, motion, and the SDK contract
  boundary explanation.

### Versioning

This is the initial public publish in the 0.x line. Patch releases are
reserved for compatible fixes. Minor releases may add exports or carry
breaking changes during the pre-1.0 phase, but any breaking 0.x minor
requires a migration note. Alignment with `@nimiplatform/sdk` remains
directional until the SDK reaches 1.0.0, at which point kit must make
an explicit 1.0.0 readiness decision.

### Migration notes

None — initial release. Consumers previously building against
unpublished workspace paths should update to the npm package name
`@nimiplatform/kit` and keep `@nimiplatform/sdk` aligned with the
compatible pre-1.0 range selected by their app.
